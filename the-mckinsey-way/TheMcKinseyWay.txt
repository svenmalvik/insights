The McKinsey Way
----------------
- MECE
- Charts

- Other things

# MECE
Be MECE. -  mutually exclusive (ME) and collectively exhaustive (CE)
Analysis - Structure - Hypothesis.
Problems are immune to the power of fact-based analisys.
Businesspeople and organizations accept only perfection.
At McKinsey, it's said that you are only as good as your last study.
Trust and verify.

## MECE Analyzing
Write an interview guide before meetings.
Prepare for meetings, always.
Always come in with a hypotheses; otherwise you waste too much time looking for ideas.

## MECE Communication
Know your solution thoroughly that you can explain it in 30 seconds.
A good business message has three attributes; brevity, thoroughness and structure.
Always let the interviewer know that you are listening. Take notes, always.
Just say, "I don't know".

# Charts
Presentate your knowledge through charts.
One message per chart.
Go for the flow with the waterfall chart.
Create simple charts.

# Other things
Before looking for a solution, get a feel for the scope of the problem.
Ask yourself at the end of the day, what are the three most important things I learned today. Put them down in a chart or two.
Always ask yourself why something is done this way? Is this the best way it can be done? Be fundamentally sceptical.
Look for best practice.
Get your job done-don't try to do the work of the whole team.
