# Takeaways fom the book - The McKinsey Way

## MECE - Mutually Exclusive (ME) and Collectively Exhaustive (CE)
- Analyse properly and collect facts exhausivly. Problems are immune to the power of fact-based analisys.
- Structure your information thoroughly and make sure your data mutually exclusive each other.
- Come up with a hypotheses; otherwise you waste too much time looking for ideas.

### Communicating information.
- A good business message has three attributes; brevity, thoroughness and structure.
- Present your message or data with charts if possible, but not too many.
- Have one message per chart.
- Write a guide before each meeting.
- Let the participants know that you are active listening. Take notes, always.

### Expectations of you.
- Know your solution thoroughly that you can explain it in 30 seconds.
- Businesspeople and organizations accept only perfection.
- It's said that you are only as good as your last study.
- Trust and verify.

### Other things.
- Before looking for a solution, get a feel for the scope of the problem.
- Ask yourself at the end of the day, what are the three most important things I learned today. Put them down in a chart or two.
- Always ask yourself why something is done this way? Is this the best way it can be done? Be fundamentally sceptical.
- Get your job done-don't try to do the work of the whole team.
- Look for best practice.
